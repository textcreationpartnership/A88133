            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THis Collection, entituled <hi>The Holy Deſires of Death,</hi> was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in its beginning a Simple and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Tranſlation of ſome Paſſages of the Fathers of the Church, which the Author made in his continual Infirmities, for the Comfort of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and of ſome perſons of Piety.</p>
            <p>Afterwards, his Manuſcript ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been view'd by very Prudent and Illuminated perſons, they judg'd that it ought to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but withall, that it was fit it ſhould be firſt enlarged and expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by a kind of Paraphraſe upon ſome of the Conceptions of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers which are couched in this Work; thereby to render it uſefull to more people by render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it intelligible to all.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:137247:3"/>
            <p>You will therefore find in ſome places, that the Authour hath pick'd out only the Senſe, and (as one may ſay) the Sap and the Juyce of the Doctrine of theſe great Saints, in explicating their Conceptions, and in adding to their Expreſſions; yet ſo as not to ſwerve from their Sentiments, nor ſtray from the Character of their Spirits.</p>
            <p>It was alſo conceiv'd that it might be permitted to ſupport their Reaſonings with the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſacred Scripture: and as that is the ſource of all their Lights, to rely principally thereupon to ſtrengthen this Work.</p>
            <p>And this Liberality appeared to be ſo much the more tolerable, by how much it was ſometimes even Neceſſary to render the Diſcourſe more conſequent, more connected, more forcible, and finally more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to ſerve for the Edification of our Neighbour, which is the
<pb facs="tcp:137247:3"/>ſole Intention we had, and which indeed one can juſtly have.</p>
            <p>For the reſt, it ought not to be taken amiſs, if among the divers Conceptions here collected from the Scriptures and from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, there are found ſome which reſemble one another; ſince even that Reſemblance hath alſo great Advantages. For beſides that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it is made manifeſt, that theſe Conceptions are not particular Opinions, it is more over a ſenſible Mark of the ſpirit of Truth which dictated them; and 'tis to be hoped that they who ſhall Read them in the ſame Spirit, will always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from them ſome new Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>
            <p>We have plac'd <hi>St. Auguſtin</hi> in the firſt Rank of the Church Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whoſe Sentiments are here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, becauſe we found his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes ſo effectual, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live'd we had reaſon to make them
<pb facs="tcp:137247:4"/>the Foundation of this Work, and to ſtyle them by the Name of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; becauſe in effect all that which enſues, whether out of the ſame St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> or out of the other Fathers, relates to the firſt Maxims which we have drawn from him, as Conſequences from their Principles.</p>
            <p>It would have been very Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and certainly very profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to joyn in this Treatiſe the Example of the Holy Fathers to their Doctrine, but the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour having already traced the Hiſtory of their holy Death in his Book <hi>Of the Death of the Juſt,</hi> you may thither have recourſe.</p>

What is it, to have this Confidence for the day of Judgment? 'Tis not to dread its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming.</p>
               <p>Some there are who do not believe this day will come. I ſpeak not of theſe impious Wretches; for what likelyhood is there that they can either deſire of dread
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:137247:14"/>that which they believe will never come to paſs?<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 1. <hi>Joan.</hi> c. 4. <hi>v.</hi> 18.</note> But as ſoon as a man begins to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the day of Judgment he muſt alſo begin to fear it. True it is that ſo long as he only fear's it, he hath not yet Confidence, becauſe he is not repleniſh'd with this Charity which animates Faith. Nevertheleſs this Fear ceaſes not to produce excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Effects. It is a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Mortification and of good Works; and it ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily falls out that by theſe exerciſes of Virtue, they come to deſire what former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they only dreaded. Then a Soul looks no longer upon that laſt day, but as the firſt of her Happineſs; nor doth
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:137247:15"/>ſhe go againſt her own Sen, timents, when ſhe Prays-ſaying; Lord, <hi>Let your King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom come.</hi> In effect, He who fears leſt the Kingdom of God ſhould come, fears alſo leſt his Prayer ſhould be heard. Judg now in what manner one Prays, when one fears to obtain what one demands: whereas he who Prays with that Conſidence which perfect Charity gives him, deſires effectually that what he demands may be ſpeedily granted him.</p>
               <p>We may therefore ſay that there are yet ſome im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect perſons, to whom Sufferings and Death ſerve only for an exerciſe of their Patience and of their Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage;
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:137247:15"/>and who are not yet ſtrong enough to deſire to Suffer or to Die. Theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſire to live lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſimply ſuffer Death when it befalls them. But there are others more perfect, who are ſo unfetter'd from Life, that in lieu of loving it as a good thing, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it as an Evil.</p>
               <p>All that the former can do, is to conquer the repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Nature, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves to the Will of God: becauſe finally they like rather to conform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to what he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained concerning them, than to leave themſelves to be tranſported with a boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs weakneſs in following
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:137247:16"/>their own will. Thus, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' the deſire of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life ſtruggles in their Heart againſt the neceſſity of Dying; yet they arm themſelves with Fortitude and with Patience to receive Death with Peace and with Submiſſion. One may ſay, That the Chriſtians who are in this Eſtate, ſuffer Death with Patience.</p>
               <p>But the Others, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire with the Apoſtle, that their Souls may be untyed from their Bodies to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Chriſt Jeſus; are not content to ſuffer Life as a neceſſary Evil: but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Death it ſelf with Joy as a great Good: becauſe they find nothing in this preſent
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:137247:16"/>Life but ſubjects of Diſquiet and of Sorrow, and that they find in Death the end of all theſe Pains, and the beginning of an Eternal Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity.</p>

                     </note>IF we conſult our Faith, and have the Sentiments which it ought to inſpire into us; we ſhall acknowledg, that Sanctity of Life and a Deſire of Death are things inſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. For one cannot be truly a Chriſtian if one loves not God, and if one aſpires not to that Eternal Life which he hath promis'd to all them who love him. We ſee it by Faith, we expect it by Hope, we love it and we deſire it by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:137247:18"/>Charity. According as a man advances in the practice of theſe Virtues, he advances al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in the exerciſe of this holy Deſire. The more ardour he hath for eternal Life, the leſs adheſion he hath to the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Life: and conſidering Death as the ſole iſſue out of this World, and as the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into that Celeſtial Life, which ought to be the object of all our Defires, he looks with Joy upon that laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is to take him from off the face of the Earth. So that when Faith and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are perfect in a Soul, the Deſire of Death is there at the ſame time ſo perfect, that it raiſes it-ſelf above that love of Life, which blind and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:137247:18"/>Nature inſpires into us. But when Virtue is yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, although Faith per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades us that Death is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious unto us, yet Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thwart's in us this holy Thought; and we then feel that we poſſeſs Life with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and ſhould loſe it with pain and difficulty; whereas perfect Chriſtians endure Life with pain, and loſe it with pleaſure.</p>

Thus, not to be willing to die ſo ſoon, is not to the Faithfull a means to acquire more Virtue; but 'tis a ſigne that they have not yet acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any.

Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtin:</hi> That there are among Chriſtians two ſorts of Fear to diſpleaſe God; One of which is deſtroyed, and the Other ſtrengthened by Charity. From whence this holy Doctor concludes, That Faithful Souls which are the true Spouſes of Chriſt Jeſus, fear nothing ſo much as to be for a long time ſeparated from this Divine Bridegroom.</head>
               <p>THere is a Fear which is baniſh'd by Charity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In</hi> Pſal. 127. <hi>Tr.</hi> 9. <hi>n Epiſt. i</hi> Joan. &amp; <hi>paſſ.</hi> 1 <hi>Joan.</hi> 28</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that word of Saint <hi>John: Fear is not found with Charity; but perfect Charity
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:137247:20"/>drives out Fear: and he who fears, is not perfect in Charity.</hi> There is another Fear, which the Royal Prophet calls, <hi>the Fear of our Lord; that pure and chaſte Fear,<note place="margin">Pſa. 18 10.</note> which remains for ever and ever.</hi> Which gives us occaſion to obſerve, That there are two forts of the Fear of God, one of which will ſubſiſt in Heaven with Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the other will be baniſh'd thence; the one will periſh with Life, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will remain eternally.</p>
               <p>I cannot better explain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you the Nature and the Properties of theſe two Fears, then in placing before your Eyes a Compariſon which ſeems to me very juſt and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſenſible. Figure to your
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:137247:21"/>ſelves two Women, One of them chaſte, and the Other unfaithful to her Husband: Is it not true, that when their Husbands are abſent, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful Woman fears at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hour the return of her Husband; and that on the contrary, the chaſte Woman fears leſt her Husband ſhould ſtay too long from coming?</p>
               <p>Our Souls are the Spouſes of Chriſt Jeſus, and during the ſtate of this mortal life, this Divine Bridegroom is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his Spouſes. Now if you agree to this truth, there remains no more, my Brethren, but to ask your ſelves concerning the nature of the Fear which you feel; to ſee whether it is either
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:137247:21"/>that imperfect Fear, which Charity ought to exclude, or that other tender and awful Fear, which is to remain eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally. O Chriſtian Souls! do not neglect this occaſion which I preſent unto you, to know well your ſelves. Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion your Conſcience: Will you know whether you truly love this Divine Bridegroom? Do you deſire that he ſhould come preſently? or that he ſhould yet for ſome time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay his coming? Behold, my Brethren, and conſider how your Heart is thereupon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſed, and from thence you ſhall know what your Fear is, and what is your love. Alas! How many Chriſtians are there to whom if one
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:137247:22"/>ſhould tell this News, Chriſt Jeſus will come to morrow to take you out of this World, they would ſay; Lord, ſtay a little longer, I have only begun to taſte Life, I have Youth and Health about me; my Houſe is not yet well eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed; my Children are in their tender age and cannot paſs without me; I have in my mind great deſigns for the publick good; the Poor have need of my aſſiſtance; I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form many good Works; I render Juſtice without Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and without Intereſt; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will poſſeſs my place, who will not perchance ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit himſelf ſo worthily. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take away from the Earth thoſe Wicked ones,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:137247:22"/>who only incommode the good people: It concerns the honour of your ſacred Name to exterminate thoſe Atheiſts who contemn you; it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns your Glory to confound that Tyrant who abuſes his power. Why ſtrike you not with Death that Uſurer who heaps up treaſures at the charge of the Widow and of the Orphan? Why take you not an exemplary chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that publick Blood ſucker who ruines a multitude of families? But as for us, who continually bleſs you, who give Alms, and who ſpread abroad in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the effects of our cares and of our Liberalities, leave us to live to honour you. 'Tis
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:137247:23"/>thus that the major part of Chriſtians would ſpeak. But as for them who are arrived at ſuch a degree of Perfection as to deſpiſe Life, the World, and themſelves; they, I ſay, who aſpire to nothing elſe but to unite themſelves to God for evermore; they would make uſe of another manner of language. Come, they would ſay, Come, O thou too long exdected Hour of the Bridegrooms arrival! Our Souls always burning with a deſire to be with him, find that all the moments of this miſerable Life which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates us from him, are ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ages.

In the mean while, there is nothing in this Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Dead but labour, ſorrow, fear, affliction, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. The perſons who are unhappy in the World, are there truly unhappy; but they who believe themſelves to the there happy, do there enjoy but a falſe happineſs; and a falſe happineſs is a true unhappineſs. Thus, to ſpeak truth, there are none but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they who ſuffer not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be blinded by the

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:137247:25"/>to comprehend the truth of theſe Words. Why doth Chriſt Jeſus call them Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py who Weep; and what Happineſs do they poſſeſs in lamenting? This Happineſs, O Chriſtians, 'tis the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Life, 'tis the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Death. They lament the length of their Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they weep out of compaſſion for the blindneſs of them who are tyed to the Earth; they weep finally out of the impatience they have to come to that dear Countrey which God hath promis'd them: and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Beauty preſents it-ſelf to their eyes upon the banks of the Rivers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they ſtay not upon them but to weep.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Bleſſed are they who weep in this manner, becauſe they ſhall be comforted,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5.12.</note> and becauſe a great recompenſe is reſerved for them in Heaven.</hi> But the better to know their Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let us mark a little the misfortune of ſuch as are in Criminal Joy of Worldlings. Their Heart is only ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the objects of their Paſſions: they make it their whole ſtudy to ſeek out new Pleaſures: yet what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever care they employ in it, a diſguſt ſo cloſely follows the enjoyment, that all their induſtry cannot ſoon enough furniſh new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to entertain this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. The exceſs of good Cheer takes away their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petit
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:137247:26"/>and ruins their Health; a tender and conſtant Freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip tire's them; the beſt entertainment grows tedious to them; their own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs perplexes and combers them; if they are in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany they would be alone, and yet they cannot endure ſolitude. The Rich envy's the tranquillity of the Poor; the Ambitious wiſhes for wealth to raiſe himſelf to honour; the Voluptuous finds that every thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodes him, and creates to himſelf a true torment by his ſolicitude in ſeeking for his pleaſure, Finally, if we look upon things but only with human aſpects, they are extremely unhappy.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:137247:26"/>But the moſt terrible of all their miſeries, is, That the diſguſt they conceive of this Life, doth not move them to deſire another. They languiſh, they ſigh, they weep ſometimes in the middle of their delights: but their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights will ſoon have an end and their tears will never be dried up: And after they have wept in this Life, they ſhall be plonged in darkneſs of Hell, where Deſpair and Rage ſhall make them weep eternally.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ep. ad Probam. Tract. <hi>4.</hi> in Ep. Joan: paſſim in Pſal.</note> That all the Life of a Chriſtian ought to be but a holy deſire of Death and of the goods of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:137247:27"/>No man, <hi>ſays this great Saint,</hi> going from Earth ſhall arrive at Heaven, to be there ſatiated with that eternal Juſtice, which makes up all the joy of the Bleſſed; unleſs he hath had an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent thirſt, and an unſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hunger thereof, whilſt he was yet in the world. And therefore it is Written, <hi>That they who have an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and they who have a Thirſt of Juſtice,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.6.</note> ſhall be happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſhall be ſatiated.</hi> It is then moſt certain, That all the Juſtice of Man upon earth, is no other thing than a Thirſt and an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of the Eternal Juſtice. But how can one deſire that Eternal Juſtice, if one love's
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:137247:27"/>Life, if one dreads Death, and if one doth not even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to die in order to poſſeſs in Heaven this Juſtice which one cannot poſſeſs upon Earth? For the Felicity of a Chriſtian cannot be perfect unleſs his Charity is alſo perfect; and the perfection of Charity is no other thing than this Eternal Juſtice, which conſiſts in knowing God and in poſſeſſing him perfectly. 'Tis for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the true Chriſtians look not upon all the things of the Earth but with the eye of Faith, nor love them but with the Spirit of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Now Faith and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity do not link themſelves to that which is periſhable.

               <p>What, I pray you, is the Idea we ought to have of Chriſtians?<note place="margin">In Apol. &amp; paſſim.</note> The Chriſtians are certain people ever-more ready to die; who have this thought imprinted in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:137247:30"/>their Spirit and this deſire engraved in their Heart; who look upon Death as the end of their ſervitude and the beginning of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. 'Tis, as one would ſay, a People and a Nation of men diſtinguiſh'd from all others by the contempt they have of Life. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are ready to loſe it; and that which afflicts o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers comforts them; for they know that Baptiſm hath already ſeparated them from the World, and therefore they are glad when Death comes to deliver them out of it for evermore. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be a want of Faith for one to teſtify the leaſt fear of Death in the moſt
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:137247:30"/>dangerous diſeaſes, or at the ſight of the moſt cruel tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Is there queſtion of ſuffering for God? One may perceive Joy painted in their countenances, they diſdain the Tyrants, they encourage their Executioners, they caſt themſelves with alacrity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the flames. All that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs their Life, retards their Felicity. Let's go die, ſay they, we are Chriſtians, we glory in it, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of a Chriſtian is to die couragiouſly for his Maſter; to happy we, who being the Diſciples of Chriſt Jeſus, may die as he did.</p>
               <p>True Chriſtians, <hi>ſays</hi> Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulian <hi>in another place,</hi> deſire with an extreme paſſion to
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:137247:31"/>break the Chains which tye them to the Earth, and to go to reign in Heaven with Chriſt Jeſus. Our Soul, 'tis true, is no longer a ſlave to the Devil, ſince the Saviour of the World hath ranſomed it; but our Body is yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his empire. He can raiſe Perſecutions againſt us, and expoſe us to the rage of our Enemies. Shall we fear him for ſo ſmall a matter? Shall we not have the courage to free our ſelves from his power? What is it that Death hath ſo terrible in it, ſince Chriſt Jeſus hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us the example of dying well? There is no other way to come to the Kingdom which he hath prepared for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:137247:31"/>us. Lets die with him, O Chriſtians, if we will reign with him. Theſe thoughts are the ordinary entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Faithful, and the continual object of their vows. The Pagans are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and the Devils deſpair, but the Angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at their reſolution.</p>
               <p>This Conſtancy which the Chriſtians teſtify in affront<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death, and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt they have of Life, are ſo linked to the Spirit of Chryſtianiſme, that even altho' the Son of God ſhould not have expreſty ſignified that Chriſtians ought to demand to die in demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Comming of his Kingdom; yet they would
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:137247:32"/>not have ceaſed to offer up to him this Petition So true it is, that the ſole character of Chriſtian ought to inſpire a continual contempt of Life, and an ardent deſire to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the Kingdom which Chriſt Jeſus hath promiſed to his Elect.</p>

                  <p>WE may ſay that they who fear Death, ſhew plainly that they know not the prime Principles of Chriſtianiſm. 'Tis ſurely to have little love for Chriſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:137247:33"/>Jeſus, to apprehend the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of his Kingdom. May not one ſay, That we are the Enemies of the Son of God, and that we fear he ſhould aſcend his Throne to puniſh them who have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him? What is there more unjuſt and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable than to wiſh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day that the Will of God may be accompliſhed, and yet to complain when it is accompliſhed?

'Tis not a deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of his Being, 'tis a changing of eſtate which is to end all his Miſeries. Since Death hath been joyned to the ſource of Life, which is Chriſt Jeſus, it hath loſt all its malediction and all its bitterneſs. It hath chang'd thoſe horrible names which affrighted us, to take the pleaſing names which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort

Now the Chriſtians call it a Sleep which charms our diſpleaſures, a Paſſage which conducts us to the Celeſtial Country, a happy Ship wreck which caſts us into the Haven. So long as man was yet in the firſt ſtate of Innocence, Death was a puniſhment wherewith the Divine Juſtice threatned him if he ſhould fall into Sin; but in the ſtate of Grace, 'tis a Sacrifice by which it purifies the Juſt, and renders him worthy of Eternal Glory. Formerly, to terify man, it was ſaid, to him; <hi>If thou Sinneſt, thou ſhalt die;</hi> and now, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port him and to encourage him in the ſufferings of this

Let's leave to the wicked the care to flatter a Body which kills the Soul, and which one cannot keep long alive. Thoſe unhappy wretches taſt not the goods of the Spirit, becauſe they have no feeling of Hope for another Life. And ſurely I do not at all wonder that they place their ſoveraign good in this mortall Life, in Health, in good cheer, and in the other pleaſures of the

But for us, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, who are convinced that all thoſe goods are but vanity, and that they will be diſſipated in leſs time than the dew of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; let us ſay with the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> would to God that by a lively Faith and by an ardent Charity I had ſo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified my Body, that it were not capable to detain my Soul: for if I could totally bury my ſelf with Chriſt Jeſus, I ſhould be aſſured to be reſuſcitated, and to live with him eternally.</p>

He ſays afterwards, That they who lament the Death of their Neighbour, or who are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid

                  </note> are for the moſt part very weak Spirits, who ſuffer themſelves to be ledd by the movings of Nature and of Cuſtom. They weep ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, becauſe 'tis the cuſtome to weep upon ſuch occaſions. They grieve for themſelves. in the perſon of another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in loſing him they loſe
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:137247:46"/>ſome advantage which they reaped from him; or elſe, they weep becauſe they fancy a falſe honour of appearing to be of a tender and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There is moreover a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pleaſure in Tears, and one delights to draw compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or eſteem from others by weeping. Finally, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever manner we weep over the Dead, 'tis always a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and we ſhould never fall into it, if we gave our ſelves time to conſider, That the orders of Providence are unalterable, and that human things change inceſſantly. For is it not a folly to grieve for the Dead as if they could have lived always; and to live ſo, as if one were never to die?</p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:137247:46"/>
               <p>To get forth of this errour, we need only to conſider a little the difference there is between the ſolid and infinite goods we hope for in heaven, and Goods ſo vain and ſo ſhort which we poſſeſs upon Earth: and we ſhall clearly ſee, That if Chriſtians ought to weep, 'tis not for that their Friends are too ſoon dead, but for that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves live too long. For the greateſt of all miſeries, is to languiſh in the World a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt all manner of Evils, and to be for a long time deprived of the happineſs which thoſe very Freinds poſſeſs whoſe loſs we lament.</p>
               <p>I demand therefore of you, my Brethren, in the firſt
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:137247:47"/>place, wherein do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Mans ſoveraign Good doth conſiſt? For if we will reaſon acccording to the Rules of Chriſtian Phyloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, the only Good which deſerves to be eall'd Good, is that which belongs to all, and for always. The Pagan Phyloſophy which reaſons only upon falſe lights, gave formerly the name of Good to ſuch things as regard on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly either mens Bodies of their Fortunes. But is it not a horrid blindneſs, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the ſoverain Good in Beauty, in Strength, in Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and in ſuch other like exteriour Qualities? Theſe wiſe profane people, did they not perceive that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:137247:47"/>theſe things, which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but to a few, diminiſh with age, periſh in a ſhort time, and are accompanied with ſo many misfortunes, that one muſt be very ſtupid not to aſpire after a better happineſs? Did they not ſee, I ſay, what we now ſee, That Riches, Dignities, and even Crowns, which without doubt raiſe men to the higheſt pitch of this falſe Felicity, paſs from one Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to another; that the moſt elevated Thrones fall down to the ground; that the moſt glittering Fortune is but a ſmoke which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated in an inſtant, and which leaves nothing elſe behind it but the ſmut of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:137247:48"/>the bad actions which were done to acquire it? Theſe men who affected the name of Wiſe, were they ſenſeleſs enough not to know, That the beſt grounded Glory is ſubject to the darts of Detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that the people, by one and the ſame capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, ſets up and pulls down the reputation of the greateſt men? If one makes uſe of Treaſures, they are conſumed; if one hides them, they are uſeleſs: But what matters it whether it be Covetuouſneſs or Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality which makes us poor, ſince the miſeries which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company poverty are not ſo unſupportable as are the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets which attend upon
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:137247:48"/>riches? Finally, theſe Wiſe perſons who had ſo great a knowledge of human things, could they not comprehend that all the Goods of this Life are meer illuſions; they who had every day the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience thereof? Ha, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, it was becauſe Faith did not clear them: it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the darkneſs of Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm Pride being the ſoul of all their thoughts and of all their actions, they ſought in themſelves a Good which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing thoſe falſe Goods and ones own ſelf.</p>
               <p>It is not ſo with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; they ſeek their ſoveraign happineſs in Humility, in the contempt of Life, and in
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:137247:49"/>their ſelf-annihilation: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are perſwaded that one poſſeſſes all in poſſeſſing God, and one poſſeſſes not him but by uncloathing ones ſelf of all things; and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that one muſt make no other proviſion for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven but that of good Works; For there one ſhall neither ſuffer hunger, nor cold, nor the injuries of Ayr, nor the cruelties of the wicked. One ſhall not there be embuſied in labouring nor in ſowing the earth, in ſayling on the Sea, in building Palaces, in traficking, in pleading, in filling the Spirit with Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in inventing laws, nor in cauſing them to be kept. There will neither be
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:137247:49"/>War, nor Proceſs, nor Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, nor Malady, nor Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty: and as the Goods there will be without end and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mixture, ſo nothing can there either corrupt or change them.</p>
               <p>Surely, when I conſider the weakneſs, of them who afflict themſelves for their Freinds departure out of the world, and who themſelves fear to follow them, I cannot ſufficiently admire it. If a man, after he had paſs'd the time of his tender Youth in an obſcure Priſon, and liv'd as it were in a continuall night, ſhould be diſpleas'd with them who obtain'd his liberty to go forth to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the Sun, the Starrs,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:137247:50"/>the Earth cover'd with fruits, and the other Beauties of the Univers, and finally to place him in a full liberty: what would you think of this man who had ſuch ſtrange humours? Without doubt, my Brethren, you would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that he had loſt his Wits, and you would ſtrive to cure him of ſo extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant a folly. Permit me to tell you that your ſelves are in the ſame ſtate, and that your errour is perhaps more deplorable than his. You are diſpleas'd at the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which your Freinds en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy in being delivered out of this, miſerable Priſon of the Body, and your ſelves fear to go forth of it to go to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:137247:50"/>contemplate in his glory the Creator of the Sun, of the Starrs, and of all the Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Univerſe.</p>
               <p>For my part, I avouch to you that I cannot conceive the cauſe of ſo great a ſtray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the human ſpirit, unleſs it is that the criminal curioſity of the firſt man hath plunged all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ſuch a profound ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, that men know not even what is convenient for them. One may ſay that we are become like unto a Child, who being yet ſhut up in his Mothers Belly, hath not ſo much as the uſe of his Senſes. This Child hath Eyes, and he ſees not, he hath Ears, and he hears not; he
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:137247:51"/>hath a rational Soul, and he knows not; he neither un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands what he is, nor what muſt become of him; finally, he hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg of Life, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs is the ſole Good in which he ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Is it not true that if this Child could reaſon, he would ſurely judge that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had not furniſhed him with all theſe faculties and all theſe organs, to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways deprived of their fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions? That having a Mouth, he was not to be nouriſhed like a Plant? That having Feet and Hands and all the other parts which compoſe his Body, he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to be always a lump
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:137247:51"/>of Fleſh, nor to live among naſtineſſes, and to be cloſe ſhut up in a Dungeon? Is it not true, I ſay, that by making theſe reflexions, he would aſſuredly come to the knowledge of the Life he was to lead upon Earth? But becauſe this Child doth not reaſon, that which ſhould rejoyce him, afflicts him: he receives as an Evil all the advantages of his birth and of his liberty; and as if he loſt a great Good in going forth of his Mothers Belly, he complains as ſoon as he comes into the World.</p>
               <p>Behold, if I am not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, an image very much reſembling theſe weak men, whom I undertook to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:137247:52"/>Now if there is any of them who hear me, who is of the number of thoſe blind perſons who will not ſee the light: Ah, my dear Brethren, I conjure you to take ſome compaſſion of his blindneſs. 'Tis ſurely a ſhame for a Chriſtian to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the Death of his Freinds, and to fear his own Death. This weakneſs is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardonable in a Child. Let us then open our Eyes, let's act as reaſonable men, let's live like Chriſtians, 'Tis high time to conceive a horrour of our Priſon, and to ſhake off the chains which detain us in it. Let's reflect that there is another Life than this; let's awaken
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:137247:52"/>our Faith; let's excite our Hope, and finally let us comfort our ſelves; lets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that our near Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have acquired an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Happineſs by the loſs of a miſerable Life: lets burn with a holy Deſire of Death: let's ſeek with ardour and receive with joy, that which will put an end to our affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and give a beginning to our Felicity.</p>

                  <hi>Article X.</hi> Among all the Fathers of the Church, <hi>St. Ambroſe</hi> is one of them who hath ſpoken beſt of Death. He made a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Treatiſe <hi>De bono mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:137247:53"/>Of the good of Death:<note place="margin">S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe.</hi>
                  </note> where he ſays, That it frees us from the miſeries of this Life, and from the ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Sin. He teaches, That 'tis Death which procures Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality to our Soul, and a glorious Reſurrection to our Body: and finally, That 'tis Death which gives us the means to teſtify our Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, our Love, and our Zeal to Chriſt Jeſus. Whence he concludes that if we have Faith, we ought to deſire Death.</head>
               <p>Life is a burthen, the weight whereof oppreſſes us; and Death is the only ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour which can diſcharge us of it. Life is a puniſhment,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:137247:53"/>and Death is the ſole means which remains for us to be releas'd of it. Did one ever ſee Slaves and miſerable Wretches fear to be ſet at freedom and to be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? 'Tis from Death alone that we muſt expect this Comfort and this liberty.</p>
               <p>Now if we ought to love it, becauſe its frees us from the miſeries of Life; ought we not to love it more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it delivers us from the bondage of Sin? For the moſt innocent of men is a Sinner as long as he is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; he muſt die to the end he may ſin no more; and his Death is no leſs the end of his Sin, than of his Life.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:137247:54"/>
               <p>But Death doth yet much more; it breaks not the bonds of Sin, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us the glorious liberty of the Elect. 'Tis Death which re-unites men to their beginning, makes them find their greatneſs and their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity in the loſs of their Lives. 'Tis Death finally, which delivering them from corruption, introduces them into an incorruptible and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life. For as ſoon as Sin had given birth to Death, God drew from thence the Reſurrection; to the end that Sin ceaſing by Death, Nature might always ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by the Reſurrection; and that man dying to the Earth and to Sin, might live eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:137247:54"/>in Glory. Then this Word of the ſacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wild be accompliſhed: <hi>Death hath been abſorp'd and deſtroyed by an entire victory:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 55.</note> and we ſhall be able to ſay with the Apoſtle: <hi>O Death, where a thy victory? O Death, where is thy ſting?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage which we derive from Death, is, That it gives us the means to imitate the Charity of Chriſt Jeſus, and to do for him in ſome ſort the ſame thing he hath done for us. We may be in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Victims of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as he hath been the Victim of our Salvation; and we may teſtify our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude by voluntarily offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:137247:55"/>to him this Sacrifice. In effect, how will it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for us to ſatisfy other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe our ſo great obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? And moreover, if we well conſider it,<note place="margin">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:137247:55"/>that of juſt men, who <hi>Live of Life,</hi> that is, who being in the Grace of God, enjoy the Life of Body and of Soul: And the ſecond, is that of Sinners and wicked men, who <hi>Live being dead,</hi> and who leading an exteriour life upon Earth, are dead inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riourly before God, As to the two manners of dying, the One is of them who <hi>die of death,</hi> that is, who in dying impenitent, endure a double Death, that of the Soul, and that of the Body: and the Other is of the Sole Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, who <hi>die to live;</hi> which is underſtood of the Elect, who endure the corporal Death with patience and with joy, to go to poſſeſs

                  <hi>ſhall live the Life:</hi> we muſt not believe that the Holy Ghoſt made uſe without deſign of ſuch an extraordinary expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>To live the Life</hi> or of Life, is to have a double Life, One of which is exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour and corporal, and the Other interiour and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; 'tis to lead the life of a Man and of an Angel both together; 'tis to enjoy at the ſame time Health and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:137247:56"/>Grace; 'tis to live of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Virtue, which includes all the natural and ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural functions; finally, 'tis the eſtate in which good people live upon Earth: an Eſtate truly happy for the time; but from which one may fall, unleſs one labours continually to diſengage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from all adheſions to Life, by the thought and by the deſire of Death.</p>
               <p>On the contrary, <hi>to die the Death</hi> or of the Death,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.</note> what is it elſe, according to the language of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but to ſuffer a double Death, of the Body and of the Soul? I mean, to be deprived of the ordinary uſe of this tranſitory Life, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:137247:57"/>of the poſſeſſion of eternal Life? And this is it which makes the miſery of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, who for having o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver much loved a criminal Life, die miſerably in their crimes.</p>
               <p>There is moreover among Chriſtians another manner of dying, which is of them, who <hi>die to life,</hi> or who <hi>die in living;</hi> that is, who are dead and living both together.

                  </note> is the foundation of all his Virtues. For he who hath ſojourned upon Earth as a Stranger, ſhall be a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen in the Kingdom of Chriſt Jeſus. What is the care of a Traveller? 'Tis to cumber
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:137247:59"/>himſelf with nothing but what is neceſſary for his journey, to take the path which is ſhorteſt and moſt ſecure, to uſe all the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence he poſſibly can, and not to fix his heart upon any thing he finds in his way, becauſe he reſerv's all his affections for his dear Countrey. According as he draws nearer to it he feels his impatience encreaſe to arrive at it; and as ſoon as he diſcovers it, he is ſo tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Joy that he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the pain he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, and the dangers he hath incurred: or if he keeps them in his memory, 'tis but as a valiant Champion remembers his wounds after

               <p>In effect, what is it that a Chriſtian can love or fear upon Earth, which is not unworthy his affection or his fear? Can all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of fortune give him a more glorious Title than that of Son of the moſt High, and of Brother of Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus?

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:137247:62"/>of Chriſtians will be ſhaken with your cruelty: becauſe Death is a deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Good for them who hope another Life, and becauſe <hi>our Kingdom is not of this World.</hi>

               <p>Nevertheleſs, do not fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that the Chriſtian remains upon the Earth, altogether ſtupid and inſenſible, as the trunk of a barren tree, which expects nothing but the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal blow which muſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it from its roots. 'Tis true that the Chriſtian de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires Death, becauſe it will end his pains: but yet he ceaſes not to make a holy
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:137247:62"/>uſe of Life He employs all the moments thereof in good works; but whatever he doth in this Life, is only to procure him a happy end of it.

But doth God ordain that he ſhould quit them to come to him? he is evermore ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part: and although, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reſentments of Nature, his Heart is as much
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:137247:63"/>afflicted in being ſeparated from his Freinds, as his Body in being ſeparated from his ſoul; yet he ceaſes not to deſire to be ſeparated from them, to the end he may always poſſeſs them with God; and he prefers this eternal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment before a poſſeſſion of longeſt durance, from which one can only derive a weak and uncertain conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Wherefore he ſays at all times with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle: <hi>Chriſt Jeſus is my Life; and Death is a gain for me.</hi>

                  </note> than to ſeparate them for ever from their beloved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject? If this Maxim is true, in ſenſual love, is it not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly more in the Divine love? A Heart deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this love, to which one ſhould ſay, you ſhall remain always upon Earth, and you ſhall never ſee God; would it not have cauſe to eſteem it ſelf almoſt as mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable as the Damned?

               <p>Before the coming of Chriſt Jeſus, Death was frightfull, becauſe men were its ſlaves, and that they could not obtain of God any more then temporal rewards for their good actions. But ſince he hath ranſom'd us by his precious Blood, ſince he hath loved Death and made an alliance with it; it is not only no longer an Evil, but 'tis the greateſt of all Goods, 'tis the ſource of all imaginable happineſſes. Thus the fear of dying ought to be conſider'd as a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:137247:65"/>weakneſs of Nature, and not as an effect of Reaſon. 'Tis true that all Creatures have an extreme deſire to conſerve their Being; but this deſire is not pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, except only in ſuch peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who know nothing of any other Life than this. The true Chriſtian who hopes after this Death a more noble and a more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Being than this firſt Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which he receiv'd by being born into the World, not only deſires not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, but burns with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to looſe it, that he may acquire the poſſeſſion of a ſoverain Felicity.</p>
               <p>There is no truth which Chriſt Jeſus preached and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:137247:66"/>aſſured more authentically than the Myſtery of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection:<note place="margin">Ib. &amp; Serm. de tridua Domini Reſurrec.</note> and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſtianiſm have more thwarted.

                  <hi>The Jews looked upon his Croſs as a Scandall, and the Gentiles as a Folly.</hi> But as for the Reſurrection, they all abſolutely deny it: only the Chriſtians believe that, and God gives to them all ſorts of proofs thereof, He permits that Souldiers ſhould be placed around his Sepulchre; he riſes forth of the Tomb in their preſence; the Stone is overturned; the Earth trembles; the Guards are affrighted; the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:137247:66"/>Women find him not where they had layd him; and the Angells aſſure them that he was riſen: He appeared to his Diſciples in particular, in publick, in divers places, in many encounters: He ſtays with them Forty days, he there drinks, he there eats; and when one of them proteſts that he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve nothing of it, unleſs he could ſee him with his Eyes, and touch him with his Hands, our Saviour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents himſelf unto him, ſhews him the Wound of his ſide, will have him to put his Finger into it, and finally forces him by this laſt proof to cry out: <hi>I doubt no longer;</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:137247:67"/>Thou haſt believed,</hi> anſwered Jeſus, <hi>becauſe thou haſt ſeen: Bleſsed are they who believe without having ſeen.</hi> Can one deſire teſtimonies more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and more authentical of his Reſurrection? If we are Chriſtians, we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it: If we will be Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, we muſt believe it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing it any otherwiſe than by the Eyes of Faith. What Happineſs ought we to expect from the Ruſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and from the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Jeſus Chriſt? Is it not to be reſuſcitated as he is, that we may reign with him? But to have a ſhare in his Reſurrection and in his Kingdom, we muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily die. Death therefore
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:137247:67"/>is an ineſtimable advantage and happineſs: and thus, we ought not to dread it, but with all our hearts to deſire it.</p>
               <p>What advantage can we find by living longer? Old age and the Infirmities which accompany it, do they not render us imſupportable to others and to our ſelves? Conſider an old man over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm'd with years, his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits dejected, his Body ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuated, his face full of wrinkles, his eyes half ſhut up, his voyce trembling, his head hanging down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Earth, as it were ſeeking for a Sepulchre wherein to be buried: Is not this a kind of Monſter
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:137247:68"/>in nature? But that which is here more monſtrous in him, is the deſire to live in deſpight of ſo many incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, and to trail along his Soul captivated and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened with ſuch heavy chains. Strange blindneſs of man! This paſſion is more violent in the very caduci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and feebleneſs it ſelf, than in the moſt tender youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. Whatever tye a man advanced in age hath for his dignities and for his treaſures, he would willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtrip himſelf of all to prolong his Life for ſome years; and he would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy theſe years in acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring other honours and other riches, of which he ſhould

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:137247:72"/>are no more exempt from theſe threats, than the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious; and altho' they are perpetually taken up with the care of keeping their treaſures, they ceaſe not to hear the voyce of Death, which ſecretly whiſpers in their Ears:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luc.</hi> 12.20.</note> 
                  <hi>To morrow I will fetch back thy Soul. All thou haſt been heaping up ſo many years, ſhall be diſſipated in the ſpace of Six Months by thy Heirs: Law-ſuits ſhall conſume one part; Riot ſhall ſwallow up the other part: and among all thy Succeſſours, not one ſhall be found who will ſo much as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to pray for thee.</hi> Thus it is that the very wicked receive inſtructions from Death, and that they learn
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:137247:72"/>of it to humble themſelves in the enjoyment of their falſe Goods; to which they would adhere yet more than they do, if they were not averted by theſe wholſom advertiſements.</p>
               <p>But this Leſſon hath never more force than in the mouth of dying perſons. Certainly, there's nothing more edifies a Chriſtian and affords him greater comfort, than to ſee a man breath forth well his laſt breath, in producing acts of Piety, of Love, and of Confidence towards God. The tranquillity which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his countenance, is an effect of the quiet of his Conſcience. The Charities which he hath exerciſed, the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:137247:73"/>ſervices which he hath ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the poor, the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don which he hath granted to his Enemies, his Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, his Faſtings, his Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, and finally all his good works, are as ſo many Angel-Gardians en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſing his Soul, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her againſt the aſſaults of the Devil. In this eſtate he explicates his laſt will without any trouble of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; he comforts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructs them who aſſiſt him; he demands of them to joyn their Prayers with his; and after the tender embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Croſs of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, he renders up his Soul upon that adorable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of his dear Saviours
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:137247:73"/>Paſſion; his Life is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed as a Light which hath no more nouriſhment; his beautiful Soul fly's to Heaven, and his Eyes are cloſed with that peaceable Sleep of the Juſt, which doth not ſeparate the Soul from the Body, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite them one day in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. What Chriſtian well perſwaded of the truth of his Religion, would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to die in this manner; and would not avouch that this Death is more deſirable a thouſand times than Life?</p>
               <p>The Death of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is a far different Leſſon; but which doth no leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them who know how to make their profit of it.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:137247:74"/>One may there obſerve viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſignes of Gods anger, a terrible effect of thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrious Words of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: <hi>You who have had no other Gods but your own paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and who have contemned my Counſells and my Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, wicked wretches, I will render ſpeedily unto you with uſurie the taunting ſcoffs which you have darted againſt me. When you ſhall be in the arms of Death, I will abandon you to deſpair and to fury. I will no otherwiſe look upon you than with diſdain, and I will take pleaſure to inſult over your miſery with a mocking laughter.</hi> In effect, thoſe Athieſts who braved Death when they conceived it to be far
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:137247:74"/>from them, are a thouſand times more weak than others, when it is near at their dores. The remorſe of their Crimes begins to gnaw their Hearts, and yet their Ears are ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all holy inſtructions. They liſten to nothing but what is ſaid concerning their Sickneſs; they complain of the inſufficiency of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, and quarrell with all that come near them; their Eyes are wandring and ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with rage; and their Mouth even yet vomits forth Blaſphemies.</p>
               <p>In this fearful eſtate all the world leaves them; their Houſe falls to the pillage of their Heyrs or of their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticks; nothing is look'd
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:137247:75"/>after but to ſecure their Goods, and to preſerve their Offices and their Dignities, whilſt their Soul is aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd for a Prey to the Devil; And very frequently, of all the Riches they poſſeſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth, there is ſcarcely found enough to bury them after their Death.</p>

               <p>When I behold on one ſide to what degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Chriſt Jeſus hath ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us, and on the other ſide when I conſider to what lowneſſe we debaſe our ſelves, I am altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded at our remiſneſs and negligence. I ſee many among Chriſtians who fear Death, not only for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for their Freinds. This weakneſs is ſo viſible
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:137247:84"/>among us, and even among perſons who ſeem to have much piety, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans publickly mock at it. For, ſay they, if the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians believe in God whom they adore, why fear they to ſee him? and if they love him, what induces them to ſhun the only thing which according to their own doctrine, muſt unite them eternally unto him?</p>
               <p>'Tis certainly to give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the wicked, to eſteem all that we ſay of the eternall Goods, and of the Reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Dead, to be meer Fables. They leſs regard what we preach, than what we do. You deſtroy by your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, what we endeavour
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:137247:85"/>to eſtabliſh by our diſcourſes; for they judge rather of the Religion of Chriſt Jeſus by your Life, than by our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. In effect, all the frights which you make ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, ſhew plainly that you have little confidence in the Word of God. When the Apoſtle S.<hi>Paul</hi> ſays; <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to die,</hi>

Thus when you teſtify ſo great an apprehenſion of Death, you make known to the whole world, that your Faith is feeble and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we ſee that you fear to obtain that which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not demand with too much

               <p>For the reſt, I bleſs God for that he will have his Church make uſe in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals of the Dead, of ſuch holy and auguſt Ceremonies as condemn your remiſneſs, and which convince you of your little Faith. For why think you do we there ſing Hymns and Pſalms, and ſet up lighted Cierges and Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but to teach you to look upon your Brethren, whilſt we are burying them, as upon victorious Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whom we ought to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:137247:86"/>with honour and with pomp in their triumph? What truer ſubject of Joy can we have for them, than to be the witneſſes of their liberty and of their victory? What have we elſe to do or ſay, but bleſs God for having call'd them to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and for having crown'd his own Gifts in them by a happy Death? Do we not thereby teſtify the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of this favour, by Words the moſt holy that can be found in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Finally, is it not for this reaſon that we cauſe our Churches to eccho forth Cantieles of prayſe and of jubilation? Surely there is nothing in all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:137247:86"/>which invite you not to a holy alacrity. For as <hi>Eccleſiaſticus</hi> ſays, <hi>Singing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords not with tears and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> Eccle. 91.</p>
               <p>Believe me, my Brethren, do not look upon Death as a frightfull thing. For if you are ſolidly Chriſtians, if you are perſwaded that there is another Life, if you believe the Reſurrection of the Dead; you will eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort your ſelves in the loſs of your Freinds, and you will wiſh that your ſelves may ſoon paſs forth of this Life ſo full of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and of myſeries, where one doth nothing but ſuffer and Sin.<note place="margin">

The true Chriſtians have made themſelves al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways known by the holy deſires of Death; but they have not acquired this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous diſpoſition by any other means than by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhackling themſelves from all the Goods of the Earth. When one hath once with
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:137247:88"/>a ſincere heart renounced them, Life is a ſmall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and one will conſider it rather as a puniſhment, than as a pleaſure.

               </p>
               <p>'Tis true, that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Moral appear's at the firſt view too ſevere to ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fual men: but if one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin's it with a Spirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyed from the ſecret intereſt of ſelf love and of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:137247:89"/>one finds nothing ſo reaſonable and ſo advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the common good of all men, nor even ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to particular perſons, whether it be for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct or for their comfort. In effect, what Religion is there in the world which propoſes a more perfect Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del than Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe Life is more pure, whoſe Miracles are more evident, and whoſe Doctrine is more wiſe and more diſinterreſſed? Do but compare it with that of the moſt prudent Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, and of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Law-makers; and you will finde that in all the Words and in all the Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Chriſt Jeſus there is
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:137247:89"/>a Character of Sanctity and of Divinity, which his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies themſelves cannot chuſe but aeknowledge; whereas in the other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins, human Wiſdom is always interwoven with ſome extravagancy, with ſome groſs intereſt, with ſome contradiction, or with ſome errour.</p>
               <p>Since therefore we make profeſſion to follow the Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſo good a Maſter; let us endeavour, O Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, to imitate him in all things.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:137247:90"/>Let's leave the World to reign; 'tis here it's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ours is not yet come.

                  <hi>we ſhall never Sin.</hi> Surely then we run an hazard to ſin of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, if we do not think that we muſt die. We fall into the ſame misfortune as do thoſe Travellers whom the night hath ſurprized in a Forreſt, and who have ſtrayed out of their way. Every one of them takes a ſeveral track, and the farther they go the more they ſwerve from the right path. Chriſt Jeſus hath ſhew'd us the way: He hath ſaid, <hi>I am the Way and the Truth.</hi> His Light conducts us amidſt the darkneſs; his Voyce calls us. He ſerves us for a guide, but 'tis by the pathway of ſufferings, and by the track of <hi>Calvary</hi> that he leads us: and all they

               <p>This different diſpoſition which men have in regard of Death, is the moſt viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Character of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination or of their repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:137247:93"/>holy diſpoſition which one ought to have for it? He teaches us at the ſame time, that the five Wiſe Virgins being totally repleniſhed with theſe holy thoughts, deſerv'd to have room in the houſe of the Bridegroom, and there to celebrate the Marriage-feaſt, the joy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhall laſt for all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</p>

If the Soul is not ſupported by an extraordinary Grace, the diſguſt of all things and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Piety it ſelf which is inſinuated by little and little, and the Imagination which black's it ſelf by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal thoughts and by deſires of dying, brings her to the brinks of Deſpair. Thoſe perſons who have lately ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtred themſelves from the World, are more expoſed to this miſery than others; untill the Divine love hath fill'd up all that emptineſs

For what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever endeavour theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons uſe, Nature never en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures the yoak of Grace without violence; 'tis in vain to tame this Nature by the continuall exerciſes of piety, by mortifications, by rigorous penances; for that inward Law of the Body e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermore reſiſts the law of the Spirit; and in the combat which is fought between them, although the Spirit gets the victory, yet it is ſometimes weakned, and foyled in its own conqueſts. Then we would die, becauſe we find no more pleaſure in living: and in theſe ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires 'tis Nature which acts

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:137247:97"/>troubled my moſt innocent occupations; I ſhut up my ſelf in a diſmal Grot amidſt the vaſt Deſerts of <hi>Siria,</hi> where the Rocks ſcorched with the ardours of the Sun furniſh'd our Solitary Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits with places of retrait, which are common to them with the Savage Beaſts. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that I could not enter there without horrour, but the occaſions of offending God appeared to me more horrible than that Solitude. Nevertheleſs in a dwelling ſo dreadfull, where I nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf only with wild Roots, my Imagination in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious to perſecute me ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to entertain it ſelf with the delights of the Roman
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:137247:97"/>Citty. I paſs'd the day in ſighing, and the night in weeping for my Sins. But the more I ſtrove to quench with my Tears the ſecret fire of my Concupiſcence, the more that rebell was enkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led even in the marrow of my bones. If ſometimes the wearineſſes of my penance forced me to abandon my ſelf to ſleep; I paid not that tribute to Nature but againſt my will: and to free my ſelf quickly from it, I ſuffer'd my body to fall to the ground, it being extenuated with watchings, and as it were broken with all ſorts of macerations. I had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Pillow than a Stone, no other Garment then a
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:137247:98"/>Hayr-cloath, no other Drink than Water, nor other Food than Herbs and Roots: and when the weakneſs of my Stomack obliged me to eat them boyled, for a more eaſy diſgeſtion; I durſt not ſatisfy my hunger, fearing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an exceſs in making good cheer. This Abſtinence and the heat of the Climat joyned to the ardour of my temper, had dryed me up like a Skeleton; and one might have counted all the Nerfs through a Skin more tawny than that of the <hi>Ethi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opians.</hi> In this ſad eſtate, I had more horrour of my ſelf, than of the Scorpions and of the Serpents which were round about me; and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:137247:98"/>yet my Spirit would eſcape on a ſodain even amidſt my moſt holy Meditations, and quit Prayer to dream of the Roman Dames, running over all the aſſemblies I had frequented formerly, where the Devil had laid his mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Baits to entrap Chaſtity. Then being irritated at the revolt of my Senſes which theſe thoughts had excited againſt me, I maſſacred my breaſt with a thouſand blows, and I left not off ſtriking it, untill the Grace of our Lord had calmed my Paſſions. He knows what my ſorrow was after ſuch ſtrange Conflicts. I bluſhed with ſhame. Life was inſupportable unto me. All the corners of my Grot,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:137247:99"/>all the Rocks of my Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſeem'd to me ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cenſurers of my Life and ſo many Witneſſes of my Weakneſſes. For this cauſe I often chang'd my habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hoping to find out ſome one where I might have more quiet, but my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil did not change, becauſe I bore every where about me the ſubject of my diſquiet. I avouch that in the height of my torments I ardently deſired to die, and that I could have wiſhed it had been permitted me to go forth of the World.

                  <hi>Article.

               <p>A True Chriſtian looks upon Death not only as upon a ſubject of conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>9.</hi> in Iſaiam; &amp; alibi.</note> but moreover as upon an object of love and of reſpect; becauſe it muſt be granted that it is God who makes us live and die when he pleaſes; and that the end
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:137247:101"/>of our days is more an effect of the Divine Will, than of human infirmity. For <hi>if the fall of the leaſt Sparrows happens not without the order of God,</hi> as himſelf ſays in the Goſpell; we ought to believe by a ſtronger reaſon, That the laſt fall of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy never happens but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the immutable decree of his Will. We ſhould therefore look on Death with Love, conſidering it as an effect of the eternal Providence. We muſt take from it that which Nature finds horrible in it; and think that God ſends it not to them whom he loves, but to the end they ſhould always love him.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:137247:101"/>
               <p>In effect, the greateſt teſtimony he can give them of his love, is to withdraw them out of the World and to free them from the ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their Body and of Sin, to render them Saints and make them eternally happy. I ſay yet much more, we are in ſome ſort made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers even upon Earth of this happineſs, when we ſubmit to his will with this Confidence. And as the laſt mark we can give of our Love towards God, is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Death with an entire Obedience, and even with Joy, when it ſummons us to go forth of the World: ſo the moſt perfect act of our Faith and of our Piety
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:137247:102"/>towards Chriſt Jeſus, is to reſign our ſelves before hand to what ever God ſhall or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain of our Life and of our Death. Let us therefore with <hi>David</hi> ſay to him:<note place="margin">

               <pb n="178" facs="tcp:137247:103"/>

               <p>Let us familiarize our ſelves with this Bugbeare; it affrights only them who dare not look near at hand upon it.

So many Martyrs, ſo many Virgins have affronted it with cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, why ſhall we not imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate them? God doth not always demand theſe bloody Sacrifices: but as for the ſacrifice of our Will, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it every hour; and I dare ſay that there is more merit to offer unto him our Life in all the moments wherein he conſerves it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, than to loſe it once by the cruelty of the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:137247:104"/>
               <p>Let us aſpire yet to a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Perfection, ſince we are Chriſtians. Let us change our Dread into Deſire, and our Averſion into Affection. We have the honour to be Heyrs to a Man-God, who hath changed the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Crime into a Sacrifice of Piety. Let us deſire Death as he deſired it: lets love Death, and lets ſeek it even between the arms of the Croſs, as Chriſt Jeſus there ſought it. Lets render to him in dying the ſame Obedience which he rendred to his Eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Finally let us rejoyce to go to find our Maſter, ſince we are his Diſciples. Let us depart with alacrity
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:137247:104"/>to come to our Father, ſince we are his Children. For if we have no love for him, nor Deſire to be near him, we are ſuppoſititious Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Children of darkneſs; unworthy to ſee the Light, and to reign one day with Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

Was there ever
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:137247:105"/>any greater extravagancy than this? For the Death of the Body is but the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and the Image of the Death of the Soul. The Man who muſt neceſſarily die upon Earth, uſes all his endeavours not to die there; and the ſame man who is deſigned to live eternally in Heaven, uſes no diligence to render himſelf worthy of that happy Life. Thus, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a will to do that which he cannot, and having no will to do that which he ought, his endeavours are uſeleſs and criminal. When he attentively conſiders that Death is inevitable, he trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and diſquiets himſelf to retard it at leaſt for ſome
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:137247:106"/>Months: But why doth he not rather conſider, that by leading a holy life, he would ſecure an infinite hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, he would ſuffer no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet, and that he ſhould die even with joy, becauſe he might juſtly hope to live happily in Eternity? We expoſe our ſelves dayly to contempt, to a thouſand per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities, and to all ſorts of vexations, and even to the dangers of loſing our Lives, in ſeeking out the means to conſerve it. And this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of living long, doth ſo ſtrangely blind men, that they ſometimes die with the ſole-fear of dying. To fly from a furious Beaſt, they caſt themſelves headlong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:137247:106"/>a River. To avoid a Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, they throw their Victuals into the Sea. Fear doth that in them which raſhneſs could not do. An affrighted man knows no longer any danger. Such a one to eſcape the kind of Death which he dreaded, expoſes himſelf to a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Deaths more terrible than that wherewith he was threatned.</p>
               <p>What torments doth not the Iron and the Fire cauſe them to ſuffer, who put them ſelves into the Chirurgions hands? They endure to have a part of their Body cut off, to ſave the other. A man who loves his health, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits himſelf as a Slave to all
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:137247:107"/>that the Phyſitians ordain him to do or ſuffer: and although he knows the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Art, he omits not to obey them in all things; nor can his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, nor the uſeleſneſs of their applications, nor the uncertainty of their skill, undeceive him. This man more ſick of Imagination than of any other Diſeaſe; feeds himſelf with a falſe hope of being cured, try's all ſorts of remedies, and haſtens his Death by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines which are given him to prolong a little while his Life. But the moſt horrible of all the effects which are caus'd by ſo blind and ſo irregular a paſſion, is, That

For fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to loſe a Life which muſt neceſſarily end, they loſe a life which muſt never end. And yet God commands us but few things, and thoſe very eaſy, to deliver us from the true Death; which we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs neglect to put in practiſe. We our ſelves on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are to be blamed if we obtain not a Life which will eternally preſerve it ſelf without the help of men, and whereof our Enemies can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver deprive us.

               <p>In effect, my Brethren, it ſeems that an exact Juſtice would require that one

               <p>God might, without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much rigour, exact of us much longer pains, and much harder labours for the Eternity of pleaſures which

But Faithfull Souls, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire only to the ſoverain Good, who deſire nothing but to be ſeparated from the impurities of the Body, ſigh in the moſt peaceable enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all periſhable Goods; and 'tis the Holy Ghoſt that forms theſe Sighs in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their Heart, to the end they may be advertiſed by this interiour ſadneſs, of
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:137247:114"/>the vanity of all worldly pleaſures. He who looks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them in this eſtate only with Carnal Eyes, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that a true Chriſtian leads a very unhappy Life, and this errour hath averted many from piety. But if they could comprehend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation which God mingles with theſe Sighs, the ſecret ſatisfaction which he ſpreads in the Soul of a good man, the peace, the pleaſure, the joy which is taſted even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the tears poured forth in theſe tranſports of Divine Love; they would ſurely change their opinion. But certainly, Senſual Souls can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not penetrate into theſe Myſteries: they muſt have

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:137247:124"/>Happy Tranquillity, Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Peace of the love of Chriſt Jeſus!

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:137247:124"/>for ever by a Chriſtian Death. And ſurely we muſt not expect to enjoy a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect calm, ſo long as we ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ upon Earth. Should we live longer, we ſhould not be more happy. The Life of our Fathers is ended, our own ſlides dayly away.

Nothing that befalls him, contriſtates him: and if he were threatned even with Death, he would be ſo far from being afraid, that he would rejoyce at it; becauſe his Heart is in the hands of God, and for that the torment of Death doth not touch him. It ſeems to the eyes of the unwiſe, that the Juſt man dies; his departure out of
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:137247:126"/>the World appears to them an affliction. They imagine that the way he takes in ſeparating himſelf from others, will bring him to nothing; whereas it is but a paſſage which leads him to peace and to repoſe. Altho' he endures a cruel Death before men, yet God repleniſhes him with a certain hope of Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. He ſuffers a little, to gain much. Our Lord hath try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him by theſe pains of ſhort durance, and hath found him worthy of his Love. 'Tis Gold which he puts into the melting veſſell to refine it. 'Tis a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctime which he ſanctifies by the Sacrifice, to make it revive one day in Eternity. The day will come, when the Juſt ſhall poſſeſs the glory of Heaven,

They who have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in him will underſtand this truth, they ſhall repoſe in his boſom, and ſhall enjoy the Peace which he hath prepared for his Elect.</p>
               <p>But as for the Wicked, who have deſpiſed and injured the Juſt, and who have withdrawn themſelves from God, they ſhall be chaſtiſed according to their crimes. How unhappy are they, to have abandonned Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſhaken off the yoak of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:137247:127"/>Juſtice! For all their hopes will be vain, their labours will be unprofitable, and their works will remain imperfect. If they have Wives they will be diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt; if they have Children, they will be unnatural; A curſe ſhall fall upon their families, and the poſterity of Adulterers ſhall be exterminated. 'Tis in vain for them to boaſt of their Riches, of their Power, of their Health. Should they live long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than other men, all the years of their Life ſhall be counted for nothing at the day of their Death.

Certainly, a happy Life doth not conſiſt in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a long time, but in li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in a perfect ſubmiſſion to the orders of Providence. What doth it ſerve us to continue upon earth even to a decrepit age?

The Hireling finds the hours of his labour over-long, and blames the Night for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſo ſlowly. The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous man counts with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content all the moments. which retard his revenues. The Ambitious man who hath conceiv'd great deſigns, would in order to haſten the ſucceſs, haſten the years of his Life. The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man makes vows to ſee his Harveſt ripen. Finally, it ſeems that men demand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to be Old, altho' they apprehend nothing ſo
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:137247:131"/>much as Old-age. In Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we wiſh the return of the Spring. Scarcely is the ſeaſon of Flowers paſt over, but we deſire that of Fruits. In Autumn we ſay that Winter hath it's pleaſures. Thus it is that the Spirit of Man, unquiet and inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to it ſelf, carries on its vain deſires from one time to another, and not enjoying the preſent, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipates always upon the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and marches by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret impatience towards his Death. What we do by a hidden motion of Nature, why ſhall we not do by the Inſpiration and by the Succour of Grace? Grace inceſſantly advertiſes us, that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:137247:132"/>this Life is ſhort and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and that we ought to aſpire to another Life which is everlaſting and happy. Sometimes the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture teaches us this Verity, by comparing Life to a Pilgrimage, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are to make what ſpeed we are able. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whiles it compares it to a Warfare, whereinto we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll our ſelves to die in fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt the Enemies of Chriſt Jeſus. At other times it repreſents Death unto us under the Parable of a Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who tills the Vinyard for the price of his days la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.

<pb n="246" facs="tcp:137247:137"/>and frivolous?

Death will ere long deſtroy this Body, in which thou takeſt ſo much complacency: but its loſs ought not to afflict thee, God will one day repair it. 'Tis Sin which thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to dread, there is thy Death, and a terrible and irreparable Death. Thou wilt be expoſed to the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:137247:137"/>of this Death ſo long as thou ſojourneſt upon Earth. Go forth of it then, my Soul, go forth of thy Priſon; ſeparate thy ſelf from thy Body: for I burn with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to die, that I may go to live eternally with my Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p>Behold what are the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of perfect Chriſtians. They have learned in the School of ſo good a Maſter, that even they who moſt deſire to die, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they are already dead to the World, yet the World ceaſes not to live to them, and to ly every where in wait to entrap them, ſometimes by applauding their Virtues, and other
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:137247:138"/>times by extolling their Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It beſieges them, it purſues them, it enchains them by ſecret confidences, by continual viſits, by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſeeking of their freind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. All theſe things ſeem only to tie an innocent knot, and which may have a very good end. Nevertheleſs the danger is great, and it is a temerarious confidence to expoſe ones ſelf thereto with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an extreme neceſſity. The World loſes nothing in this traffick; on the contrary, it ſerves it very frequently for an honeſt Veil to hide its Vices: but the Juſt man runs a great hazard thereby, and ſits down always with the loſs. The Devil, who is
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:137247:138"/>but too ingenious to deceive us, employs a thouſand ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til crafts, diſguiſes himſelf into all manner of ſhapes, and even into that of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in order to ſeduce us. At firſt he diſtills light diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, little ſolicitudes, vain deſires, unprofitable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſities, which diminiſh by little and little the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of our devotions, and which eſtrange from our memory the thoughts of Death. Then the ſame Spirit which cools the Love of God, enkindles inſenſibly in our Soul thoſe former affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which repentance and Charity had there as it were ſtifled and buried. Alas? how few Juſt perſons are
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:137247:139"/>found who entirely imitate <hi>S. Paul</hi> in this double Death of the Chriſtian to the World, and of the World to the Chriſtian! Where are they whoſe Conſcience renders to them the ſame teſtimony as it did to this great Apoſtle, and who have put themſelves into a perfect liberty, by breaking not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iy all the Chains which kept them faſt tyed to the World, but moreover thoſe which tyed the World to them. For 'tis not enough to have deſpiſed and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the World; we muſt ſo order it, that the World may deſpiſe and abandon us. This is that which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle intends to teach us,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:137247:139"/>when he ſays: <hi>The World is dead and crucified for me, as I am dead and crucified for the World.</hi> The World was crucified to him, becauſe it was dead in his heart, and was no more any thing to him but the object of his contempt and of his hatred: but beſides this, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo crucified to the World, becauſe having made appear an inſenſibility for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the Earth, the world ceaſed to ſeek after him, and did no longer ſo much as think of him.</p>
               <p>If we take not heed, we ſhall find that even in the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired profeſſions, in the greateſt diſguſt of the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of the infidelities, and
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:137247:140"/>of the corruptions of the world, when we fancy that we are for ever freed from them; yet there ſtill remain ſome roots thereof in our Heart. We hold no more of the world, but it holds us yet by imperceptible bonds. We make a ſhew of ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, and yet we are not ſorry that it ſhould ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter us, and that it ſhould come ſometimes to trouble our ſolitude, which would otherwiſe appear to us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and inſupportable. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, with a mean Virtue one may forget the world, but one muſt have an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Virtue to wiſh to be forgotten by the world. This is that which holy Souls
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:137247:140"/>aym at, which are perfectly unfettered from the world, They not only ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not to be drawn by the World, but moreover they draw not the World to themſelves. And 'tis to them that may be applyed the ſaying of S. <hi>Paul:</hi> Man and the World are recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Crucified, one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the other; becauſe they not ſeeking one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor mutually loving each other, are as two dead things which can no longer have any communication.</p>
               <p>But alas! how few there are who can come to he hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of this double Death? The greateſt Saints, all cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified as they are to the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:137247:141"/>World, cannot without the ſuccour of an extraordinary Grace, crucify the World entirely in themſelves. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is that they inceſſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mortify themſelves, and they cry out with David: <hi>Lord,</hi>

The natural Heat which ſuſtains his Life, devours its proper ſubſtance as ſoon as it wants nouriſhment. If he repoſes, ſloath renders him unweldy; if he is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, labour drains him; if he eats, the meat over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges him; thirſt dries

Finally, on which ever ſide he turns himſelf, he is tormented by the Evil, or by the Remedy.</p>
               <p>The Soul hath no leſs weak neſſes and miſeries than the Body. You ſee her one day deceived by Hope, and on the morrow troubled with Fear; Anger tranſports her; Sadneſs dejects her, Joy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipates her, Envy gnaws her, and nothing contents her. One Paſſion follows another; and ſometimes for one that
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:137247:144"/>is deſtroy'd, there ſpring up a thouſand. The ſacred Scripture compares this agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to the dreadful Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts which are raiſed upon the Waters:<note place="margin">

                  <hi>I find in my ſelf a Will to do Good, but I find not the means to accompliſh it. For I do not the Good to which I have a will, and I do the Evil which I would not.</hi> There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing good in Man. He is ſubmitted both together to the Law of God according to the Spirit, and to the Law of Sin according to the Fleſh. God and the World draw him by turns. He is a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound of all that which is moſt motley in Nature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and in every thing unlike to himſelf, His man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:137247:145"/>his opinions, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, all his actions, all his thoughts, are in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall inſtability. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one may ſooner ſtop the courſe of the Winds, and the rapidity of a Torrent, than fix his inconſtancy by the ſole force of Reaſon. Thus, the more our Soul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amins her ſelf, the leſs ſhe knows her ſelf. Who am I, for example, I who make ſo many reflections upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? What is the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that ſtirs all the parts of my Body? By what means do they come to know the orders of my Will? How can they execute them with ſo much readineſs? But this will, what makes it ſpring
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:137247:145"/>up in me? Whence proceeds this intelligence which guides it, theſe lights which clear it, theſe darkneſſes which ſometimes encompaſs it? It walks upon the wings of the winds, upon the points of the Waves; it penetrates the higheſt Heavens; it deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends into the center of the Earth; it carries its curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into every corner; and yet the moſt common and the moſt ſenſible objects hide themſelves from its know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: in a word, it knows not what it ſelf is. Man thinks, and he knows not what it is to think; he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and he cannot ſay what reaſon is. The Soul is united to the Body, and ſhe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:137247:146"/>conceives not how ſhe is united to it; ſhe enters not there, and ſhe goes not from thence when ſhe pleaſes; the matter which ſhe ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, ſerves her for a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and by an inclination oppoſit to her nature, ſhe loves this Priſon which keeps her captive. The Senſes which ſhould be in all things ſubject unto her, revolt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly againſt her, deceive her, and corrupt her. 'Tis an aſſembly of qualities which are mortal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, which are corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and incorruptible. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is not ſo contrary to Fire, as theſe Qualities are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary among themſelves; yet all agree together in one and
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:137247:146"/>the ſame ſubject, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that 'tis impoſſible to ſay either what makes their mutual intelligence, or what breaks it. One cannot number all the kinds of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which may ſeparate the Soul from the Body; and yet the Soul acts as if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were able to ſeparate her from it. She heaps up deſigns upon deſigns, hopes upon hopes, and there needs no more than a blaſt to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn all. <hi>O Man, thou confuſed Pile of uncertainties and of miſeries,</hi>

The blind Lovers of the World believe that we in this eſtate lead a life here below full of bitterneſs: but 'tis becauſe the blindneſs of their Spirit renders them uncapable to conceive the ſweetneſſes wherewith the Love of Chriſt Jeſus inceſſantly fills the Soul of the Juſt, even
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:137247:156"/>whilſt ſhe is yet a captive within the Priſon of her Fleſh.

He looks on Death as a Sanctuary and a ſecure Harbour. He leaps over this paſſage which is ſo ſhort, as a Bridge to thwart the impetuous tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of this Lives bitterneſs. Finally he deſires Death as
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:137247:159"/>the term of his baniſhment, as the day in which he is to ſhake off his fetters, and to free himſelf for ever from the miſeries which oppreſſed him.</p>
               <p>Now if God gives this Grace to perſons remaining in the World, he gives it yet more abundantly, to good Religious, and ſuch as are truly Solitary; becauſe they have embraced a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, into which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by a Spiritual Death, by ſeparating themſelves from all things which affoard any adheſion to the Life of the Body. In effect, what is it that a true Solitary perſon can fear in Death? or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what will he not there
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:137247:159"/>find to deſire? He learns in his little Cell to uncloath himſelf of all that is in the World. He makes it in his retrait his continual ſtudy to contemplate the felicity of Paradiſe. A Cell and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven have a near relation to one another: what is done in Heaven, is done alſo in a Cell: one is there employ'd upon God; there one en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys God and the ſociety of Angells; there one leads a Life altogether Celeſtial. The Cell is a holy place, 'tis a ſacred Mountain, where the Soverain Maſter of the World, uncloathing himſelf, if we may ſay it, of all his Majeſty, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertains himſelf with
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:137247:160"/>his Servant, without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, without reſerve, as one freind with another.</p>
               <p>And even as the Temple is the Sanctuary of God, ſo the Cell is the Sanctuary of a true Religious man. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his, Soul raiſes up her ſelf to the enjoyment of the bleſſed. Eternity, either by fervent Prayer, or by a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Death, ſhe finds a ſhort and eaſy way from the Cell to Heaven. The weight of earthly of affections hinders not her flight thither. The Love of God wherewith ſhe is enflamed lifts her above the Earth by a ſecret force like that of the Adamant. They who are in ſo ſublime an eſtate, have not only acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:137247:160"/>Sanctity, but moreover the perfection of Sanctity, and the very height of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection it ſelf. But let them give thanks to the Authour of theſe Favours with a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Humility.

               <p>Is that call'd a Living which we live here below? All our days are full of darkneſs, of bitterneſs, and of ſorrow. Our Soul is there upon the rack through a continual fear of Sin.

Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he ſcarcely ever thinks of the uncertainty of his condition.

How often have you heard ſay, of them who were ſeen yeſterday ſo flouriſhing: One of them was murdered, the other was drown'd, another died in playing; and he who ſeem'd to have moſt health, expir'd ſitting at table? One ſhould never have done, if one ſhould run over all the manners of Death, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with dayly and diſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples ſtrike our eyes; and yet what profit do we make thereof?

One acquires this happy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight by the contempt of the World, by the deſire of advancing in Virtue, by a ſincere repentance, by a blind obedience to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Providence, by an uncloathing and deſpiſing of ones ſelf, accompanied with a firm reſolution to ſuffer all for Chriſt Jeſus.

Tottering between two ſo oppoſit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I am a burden to my ſelf, and I deſire ardently to die, that ſo there may be an end of all theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats which put me in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual danger to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Enemy of my Salvation.

In effect, 'tis no longer a puniſhment, 'tis a favour, and a favour by ſo much the greater, by how much the ſooner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. For that which was a chaſtiſement of Sin, is now a temporal recompenſe of good Works. We ought therefore to look now upon it as the object of our ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hopes, and not as the ſubject of our Fears. O Death! thou art no longer bitter, thou art no longer cruel to the Diſciples of Chriſt Jeſus, as thou wert formerly to the Children of <hi>Adam.</hi> Let us bleſs our Lord, for having made the moſt
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:137247:170"/>terrible of all Evils, to be ſo wholeſome and ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal a remedy, which frees us from all ſorts of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities and miſeries; which exempts us from the misfortunes of poverty, from the outrages of our enemies, from the attacks of envy, from the diſquiets of avarice and of ambition; in a word, from the tyranny of all our paſſions: &amp;c, (which is yet more deſirable) which exempts us from Sin. Death having thus changed its nature, Chriſtians have no longer any averſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they deſire it as much as other men dread it: and they invite to their aſſiſtance that which the World avoyds

As they have more love for Chriſt Jeſus, they have alſo a greater deſire for Death. The ardour of this Love gives them ſuch an abſolute contempt of Life, and ſuch an impatience to get out of it, that there is not a moment in which they wiſh not the ſeparation of their Soul from their Body.

               <p>You declame againſt the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of men, who neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard deſert nor virtue, who beſtow Offices upon birth or favour, and who ſleight the good people without confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them any reward. Why then do you not aſpire

               <p>Kings cannot exerciſe their magnificence and their Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie, which are their moſt ſhining virtues, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very often deceived by outwards apparences. As they know not the true ſpirit of their Subjects, they cannot diſcern their true deſerts. They frequently favour Vice, when they intend to render Juſtice to Virtue. But the God
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:137247:178"/>whom we adore, cannot be deceived. He reads in the Heart of them who ſerve him. He diſcerns all our actions; and as he beholds all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Will, he alſo lets not impietie paſs without puniſhment, nor Virtue with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reward.</p>
               <p>You complain of the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your condition, you murmure for that you muſt always fight, you grieve to be inceſſantly encompaſſed with enemies, you bear them about you, you nouriſh them within your ſelves, and you are the theater of this inteſtine War, where the Fleſh is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at ſtrife with the ſpirit. On which ever ſide the victory falls, you cannot rejoyce,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:137247:179"/>without being afflicted at the ſame time for ſome loſs. Leave then this wretched dwelling, where Life is a continual temptation and a perpetual combat. Deſire Death, which will be the end of all theſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries. Sight after that agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble habitation, where the Saints enjoy a perfect victory, and a peace without moleſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Do not any longer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that in deſpight of all the care you take to bring one part of your ſelf to agree with the other part, yet their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are dayly renewed: Or if you will complain, let this your complaint ſerve at leaſt to make you march more ſpeedily towards that place of peace, where you ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree

               <p>Finally, you love Life, but you would not have it to be made up of miſeries and of ſorrows. Shall God make Life for you after another manner than it was for his own Son? To come to that Life which you demand, you muſt be gon out of this. Chriſt Jeſus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath ſhew'd us that we muſt acquire it at that rate. Why ſeek you not that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, where the Life which you deſire hath his habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? From the firſt moment in which you ſhall poſſeſs Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, you will no longer fear either poverty, or miſery, or diſeaſe, or death. Why then do you not that, for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:137247:180"/>of ſo happy a Life, which you do for the prolonging of this other unfortunate Life? You abſtain from Meats and from Divertiſements which are hurtfull to your health. Why do you not as much for that Life which will never be troubled with any ſickneſſes? And yet the ſolicitudes you have to preſerve your Body, will not warrant it from Death. All that you can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, is to die a little later. Ah! my dear Brethren, can it be poſſible that you ſhould do leſs to live eternally? No I cannot believe it; and you will teſtifie without doubt by your actions, by your ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and by the <hi>Holy Deſires of Death,</hi> that you have a Faith
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:137247:180"/>and Hope for another Life.</p>
               <p>What would you give to be exempt from all incommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and to be aſſured to live always? Is it not true, that all whatever you poſſeſs, would not ſuffice to purchaſe ſo great a good, altho' you were Lord even of the whole Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe? Yet this ſo great and excellent a good is to be ſold: You may buy it, if you will: the price ought not to affright you: it will not exceed your a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities: you ſhall pay no more for it then what you are able to give: you may purchaſe it by an Alms; you may acquire it by ſome other good Works; you may deſerve it by a good deſire; finally you may obtain it by a penitential Life, and by
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:137247:181"/>a holy Death. Do not then deſpiſe a happineſs which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends only on the will to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs it. And if you have any ſpark of zeal left in you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote your true Intereſt and to procure your own Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſeek a dwelling where Truth is victorious, where Sanctity is honoured, where Peace is immutable, &amp; where Life and Felicity are Eternal.</p>
