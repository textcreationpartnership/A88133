that of juſt men, who Live of Life, that is, who being in the Grace of God, enjoy the Life of Body and of Soul: And the ſecond, is that of Sinners and wicked men, who Live being dead, and who leading an exteriour life upon Earth, are dead interiourly before God, As to the two manners of dying, the One is of them who die of death, that is, who in dying impenitent, endure a double Death, that of the Soul, and that of the Body: and the Other is of the Sole Predeſtinate, who die to live; which is underſtood of the Elect, who endure the corporal Death with patience and with joy, to go to poſſeſs

      * The Fourth Maxim of St. Cyprian: That Death ought to be conſider'd by Chriſtians as a paſſage from the miſeries of this Life to a glorious Immortality.

    _ Article XXXXII. It may perhaps ſeem ſtrange that we ſhould place the thoughts of St. Tereſa in a collection of thoſe of the Fathers. But the Writings of this great Saint are repleniſh'd with ſo ſublime a piety, that one may compare them in this point to the moſt beautious Works which the Spirit of God ever dictated to men.

would prove profitable to inſert here ſome of the admirable Sentiments ſhe hath left us upon the meditation of Eternity, and upon the deſire of Death.
